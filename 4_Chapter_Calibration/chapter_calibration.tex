\section{KLG4 Simulation Tuning Overview}
KamLAND analysis is informed by two particle physics simulation suites. The first is KLG4sim a Geant4 based simulation suite developed for KamLAND. KLG4sim, reproduces the KamLAND detector and faithfully reproduces all of its copmonents. These components include PMTs, support structures, detection media, thin plastic balloons, outer tank, and more. Radioactive decays are simulated by generating particles emitted by these decays with the proper distributions.
