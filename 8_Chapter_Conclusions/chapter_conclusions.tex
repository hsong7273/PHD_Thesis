\section{Conclusion}
This dissertation presents a preliminary, simplified analysis of the search for $2\nu\beta\beta^\ast$ in KamLAND-Zen 800, using 745kg of $^{136}$Xe isotope instrumed in a liquid scintillator calorimeter detector. Building on previous analyses of KamLAND-Zen 800 data, this thesis presents new estimates of key low energy backgrounds that were previously unconstrained. Namely, $^{11}$C produced by cosmic muon spallation, and innate $^{40}$K contamination of the inner balloon film.

A spectral fit of the KamLAND-Zen 800 data in a reduced fiducial volume was performed and limits were calculated.The Feldman-Cousins calculation gives a preliminary,aggressive limit on the half-life of $2\nu\beta\beta^\ast$, $T_{1/2}>4.25\times 10^{24}$yrs 90\% C.L. which would be a new world-leading limit. But this limit is taken neglecting important detector response systematic uncertainties.

Subsequent analyses of KamLAND-Zen 800 data will be able to more robustly search for $2\nu\beta\beta^\ast$. Improvements in detector response modeling will reduce systematic uncertainties in detector energy scale. These detector response parameters have an effect on the shape of the ground state double-beta decay background which has large implications for $2\nu\beta\beta^\ast$ sensitivity. Resolving mismodeling of the radial distribution of background near and just beyond the inner balloon will allow the expansion of the fiducial volume and the rejection of film-originating background events.

Finally, machine learning techniques have proven effective at discriminating between single-site energy depositions, such as ground state $2\nu\beta\beta$, and multi-site energy depositions like $2\nu\beta\beta^\ast$, as shown in Reference ~\cite{KamNet}. These classifiers can serve to reduce the predominant $2\nu\beta\beta$ background and improve the signal-to-background ratio by 7.6\%.
