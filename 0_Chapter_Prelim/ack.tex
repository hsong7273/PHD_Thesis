Now that it is finally time to reflect and look back on the over 6 year journey that has been my PhD, I am overwhelmed by the sheer number of people who contributed to my development over this time.

My advisor, Prof. Christopher Grant, gave me the precious gifts of his guidance, lectures, and near unlimited claim to his time. I will always be grateful for how he'd proactively search for development opportunities, be they in other groups, other universities, and in other countries. Prof. Lawrence Sulak gave a patient demonstration of how to be good experimentalist and the opportunity to work at CERN. Profs Kearns, Carey, Miller, Winslow, Axani, Li, Schmaltz, Ozaki, Shimizu, Ishidoshiro, Orebi-Gann, Anatoli, and many other professors, postdocs, technicians, and engineers I'd like to thank for the gifts of collaboration and lessons.

My fellow graduate students in the BU neutrino group, will always hold a special place in my heart for being confused with me, until we weren't. And I count myself incredibly lucky to have entered graduate school with such a fun, vibrant cohort, the entering BU Physics class of 2019. 

Finally, my parents gave me the ultimate gifts of their support and love without which none of my achievements large and small would be possible.

I hope to make the most of what I've been given and make everyone proud.
