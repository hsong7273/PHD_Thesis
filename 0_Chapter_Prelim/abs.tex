% ABSTRACT

Two-neutrino double beta decay to excited states ($2\nu\beta\beta^\ast$) provides crucial experimental constraints on nuclear matrix element calculations that are essential for interpreting neutrinoless double beta decay searches. This dissertation presents a search for $2\nu\beta\beta^\ast$ of $^{136}$Xe using data from the KamLAND-Zen 800 experiment, which contains 745 kg of xenon enriched to 91\% in $^{136}$Xe. The analysis uses 4.3 years of data collected between February 2019 and April 2023, corresponding to over one ton-year of $^{136}$Xe exposure. A comprehensive background model is developed using Monte Carlo simulations calibrated with in situ sources, and a binned maximum likelihood fit is performed in the energy range of 2.5--4.8 MeV. Independent studies to estimate the strength of important low energy backgrounds are described in this thesis. No statistically significant excess is observed, and a 90\% confidence level upper limit on the $2\nu\beta\beta^\ast$ half-life is set using the Feldman-Cousins method of $T_{1/2}>4.25\times10^{24}$ years 90\% C.L.. This study serves as an important preliminary analysis in the search for $2\nu\beta\beta^\ast$ in KamLAND-Zen 800.
